# Arrays

An array is perhaps the quintessential data-strucre and there is a reason that array is usually the first data-structure covered in any programming language and that reason is simple - the array is the workhorse of any engineer's toolkit and mastering it's implementation will greatly enhance the engineer's skillset that chooses to commit oneself to that task.

An array is a sequential collection of items and its implementation can vary greatly. Some arrays are fixed in size, while others are dynamicly-sized; moreover, some are single-dimensional, while others may be multi-dimensional or even jagged. This directory contains several different implementations of the array in a variety of the most-popular programming languages. Thanks for browsing my content!
