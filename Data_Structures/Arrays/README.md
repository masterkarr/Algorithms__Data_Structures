# Arrays

An array is perhaps the quintessential data-strucre - is a sequential collection of items having a fixed size. Arrays come in variety of flavors and several shapes and sizes - some are fixed, while others are dynamic; some are single-dimensional, while others may be multi-dimensional or jagged.

There is a reason that array is usually the first data-structure covered in any programming language and that reason is simple - the array is the workhorse of any engineer's toolkit and mastering it's implementation will greatly enhance the engineer's skillset that chooses to commit oneself to that task.
