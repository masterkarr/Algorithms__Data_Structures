# Data_Structures__Algorithms
My implementation of industry standard data-structures and algorithms.

To the reader: thank you for browsing my repository featuring my own descriptions and implementations of the most foundational and industry statndard data-structure and algorithms. I have dedicated a considerable amount of time to creating and populating this repository featuring implementations in several of the most-popular programming languages at the time of the creation of this repository. If these implementations in the programming languages are relevant to you, then it is my hope that you find what you are searching for and the information contained herein valueable to you. If this repository is still around and the code is antique while you browse this content, please know that I would have a smile on my face to know that content within this repo still has value today. Dear reader, thank you for stopping by and stay classy!
